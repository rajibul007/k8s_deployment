 Sed Command to Delete Lines - Based on Pattern Match

 Delete lines that begin with specified character

> sed '/^u/d' file

11. Delete lines that end with specified character

> sed '/x$/d' file

$ is to indicate the end of the line. The above command deletes all the lines that end with character 'x'.

12. Delete lines which are in upper case or capital letters

> sed '/^[A-Z]*$/d' file


13. Delete lines that contain a pattern

> sed '/debian/d' file


14. Delete lines starting from a pattern till the last line

> sed '/fedora/,$d' file

Here the sed command removes the line that matches the pattern fedora and also deletes all the lines to the end of the file which appear next to this matching line.

15. Delete last line only if it contains the pattern

> sed '${/ubuntu/d;}' file
